    //github by default merges using fast forward (ff)
    //but pull requests in general are using no-ff (no fast forward)

    //keep that in mind since it was a bit tricky to understand at first -> it is also worth noting and merge sqash / merge rebase
    //can sometimes be helpful too and its all about the usage case -> but to get the known github branch history that you also get when using prs
    //use no-ff

    //doing a pull request and then approving it yourself does pretty much the same thing so you can just skip that and immediatly do it like this
    //prs are just for repos YOU DO NOT OWN -> which is never the case in our scenario
