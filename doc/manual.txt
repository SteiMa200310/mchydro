Level 1
You given a load of items with which you should transform enough electric energy to power a certain reciever.
Those items contain 3 Power Providers (Windmill, Solarpannel, Waterwheel), which you can connect with a cable.
Furthermore you get a cablemerger which can be used to connect up to 5 input cables to one output cable.
Also you are provided with a voltmeater to check the current power level on each cable, and a wrench to destroy already placed components.

Goal:
	Produce 20 power units (power level) and direct the energy into the electric core
	
Level 2
Now its time to craft the electrolyzer.
Beneath your feet you can see the required recipe to solve the task.
You are currently in the bosch ressource storage.
Fun fact
	one rod is considerd the annode (red) and the other the catode (blue)
	together with the membrane those components build the base for the actual electrolyzer in real life

Goal:
	Collect all the necessary items and craft the electrolyzer
	
Level 3
Finally its time to complete the mission.
Connect the electrolyzer with the power, but wait something is missing.
In order to create hydrogen - water is also a required component.
You need to setup a water pump and connect it together with the electric energy to the electrolyzer.
Finally you need to connect the produced hydrogen and oxygen to the network.

Fun fact
	Water is H2O - in the electrolyzer H2O is splited into H2 and O which results in an hydrogen molicule and an oxagen atom
	Now we repeat this process, and the two oxigen atoms merge to an oxigen molecule - which is the air you breath day and night :).

Goal:
	Setup a water infrastructure and connect it and the electric energy to the electrolyzer.
	Connecting the two outputs from the electrolyzer to the specifc transpoters completes the game.
