no nullable
no extension methods
no pre defined generic delegates (Func Action) -> despite the fact there are Supplier and Consumer / and some other minor impls like Bi and Tri Functions
	java cannot differ between generic overloads -> which is something c# does implicitly with names like FuncÂ´1
no nested Function
no partial Classes
base types cannot be used as generic arguments "WRAPPER" are required
fucked up nested classes
no operator overloading not even thinking of initializer / indexer / implicit operator overloads for class construction like new() evaluating which constructor based on type
everything in seperate file
no expressions -> predicate name missused
interfaces do not support properties
